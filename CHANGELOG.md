# citeproc changelog

## 0.8.1.2

  * Allow containers 0.7 (#143)

  * Update tests to use Diff >= 1.0 (#146).

  * Fix `dropTextWhile` and `dropTextWhileEnd` in Citeproc.Pandoc.
    Ensure that they treat SoftBreak like Space (jgm/pandoc#10451).

## 0.8.1.1

  * Include `10/` prefix in short DOI links (#136).

  * Properly implement `demote-non-dropping-particle="sort-only"` (#141).
    We had previously gotten sorting behavior right for this, but
    not display behavior.

## 0.8.1

  * In Pandoc and CslJson CaseTransform, group punctuation in clusters (#127).

  * Fix sorting on dates (#126). Previously this broke for some styles,
    e.g. apa.csl, which styles dates as MM/DD/YYYY, and would lead to
    incorrect sorting of dates with months and/or days.

  * Add citation-key variable from citeId. This is a new addition in CSL 1.0.2.

  * Update locales from upstream.

  * Raise an error if multiple layout elements are present (#120).

  * Fix two test cases. They had illegal bibliography elements with
    no layout children.

  * If there are multiple layout elements, only use the last one.
    This can happen with CSL-M styles. The last layout should be
    locale-unspecific. This change will prevent us from emitting
    doubled citations or bibliographic references (see #120),
    allowing more graceful handling of CSL-M styles, even though we
    don't support CSL-M.

## 0.8.0.2

  * Fix missing locator after collapsing and grouping with year
    suffix (#96).

## 0.8.0.1

  * Fix disambiguation edge case (#116). We weren't properly
    disambiguating when only one of two ambiguous names had a
    subsequent citation.

  * Chicago page numbering fixes.

  * Update test suite form upstream.

  * Handle whole-citation links differently in `secondFieldAlign` (#113,
    Benjamin Bray).

  * Require data-default >= 0.5.2 (#114, Bodigrim).

## 0.8

  * Add `SubstitutedVal` constructor for `Val` [API change] (#101, #108).
    This is used to track variables that are repressed due to substitution.
    (We can't just delete them, because they still count when we have
    "if" elements that check for a variable.)

  * Fix logic for including a group. A group with a text node and an
    empty variable should count as empty.

  * CaseTransform: don't change words that are a mix of uppercase
    and nonletters, like CRT1000.

  * Fix label with "page" variable (#107).

  * Fix error in test suite. We stripped indentation in the expected result
    in some cases.

  * Update fr-FR locale from upstream.


## 0.7

  * Handle old term form `sub verbo` as if it is `sub-verbo` (the new form).

  * Update to latest locales in CSL repository.

  * Makefile: Fix update-locales target.

  * Keep explicit "et al." (#102, Albert Krewinkel).

  * Factor out `deleteSubstitutedVariables`.

  * Add any references in `citationItemData` to references.

  * Add `citationItemData` field to `CitationItem` [API change].
    This corresponds to the `itemData` that can appear
    in the JSON representation of a citation item.

  * Add Ord, Eq instances for `Reference`, `DisambiguationData`, `Val` [API change].

## 0.6.0.1

  * Ensure that position evaluates false inside bibliography (#99).

## 0.6

  * Add Term parameter to TagTerm [API change].

  * Add TagPrefix, TagSuffix constructors to Tag [API change].

  * Make sure that extracted AuthorOnly names have the correct
    formatting (#55).

  * Do case-insensitive sorting, like Zotero (#91).

  * Ignore "ibid" entries in computing ambiguities.

  * Improved disambiguation for author-in-text citations.

  * In disambiguating, convert author-in-text to normal citations.
    Otherwise we disambiguate incorrectly.

  * Fix title disambiguation with note style (#90).
    Previously we'd been calculating ambiguities by generating
    renderings for citation items independently of context.
    This meant that we didn't detect ambiguities in "subsequent"
    citations (which might e.g. just have an author).

  * Ensure we don't do collapsing of items across a prefix or suffix (#89).
    If we have `[@doe99; for contrasting views see @smith33; @doe00]`,
    we don't want to get collapsing to
    `(Doe 1999, 2000; for contrasting views, see Smith 1933)`.
    This isn't strictly by the spec, but it gives better results.

  * Allow collapsing after an initial prefix.


## 0.5

  * Add `linkBibliography` field to `CiteprocOptions` [API change].
    When this is set to True, we hyperlink bibliography entries according
    to the draft of the CSL v1.02 spec (Appendix VI).  When an entry has
    a DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL available but none of these are rendered
    by the style, add a link to the title (or, if no title is present,
    the whole entry), using the URL for the DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL
    (in that order of priority).  (Benjamin Bray, #88.)

  * In generating citation labels, only use `issued` date.
    Not, for example, `accessed` (#80).

  * Citeproc.Locale: export `lookupQuotes`.  [API change]

  * Citeproc.Types: Add `localizeQuotes` method to CiteprocOutput class
    [API change].

  * Citeproc.CslJson, Citeproc.Pandoc: Implement `localizeQuotes`.

  * Citeproc: apply `localizeQuotes` after rendering.  This ensures
    that quotes are properly localized and flipflopped.  Previously this
    was done in `renderCslJson` (for CSL JSON) and in pandoc
    (for Pandoc Inlines).  It is more consistent to do this as part
    of the rendering pipeline, in citeproc itself.

  * Citeproc.CslJson: Drop the Locale parameter from the signature of
    `renderCslJson` [breaking API change].  It was only needed for quote
    localization, which now occurs outside of this function.

  * Citeproc.Pandoc: use a Span with class csl-quoted for quotes,
    rather than a Quoted inline.  This way we can leave Quoted elements
    passed in by pandoc alone, and we won't get strange effects like the
    one described in #87 (where `"` behaves differently when in
    a citation suffix).

  * Default to Shifted with `icu` flag (#83).  This makes the library
    behave similarly whether compiled with `icu` or with the default
    `unicode-collation` and prevents test failures with `icu`.

  * Require recent text-icu with icu flag.
    Older versions don't build with newer versions of icu4c.

  * Support links in CslJson (Benjamin Bray). Currently they are
    only supported in rendering, not parsing (in support of #88).

  * Allow test cases to specify CiteprocOptions (Benjamin Bray).

  * Update locales from upstream.

  * Add new CSL tests to repository.


## 0.4.1

  * Change Pandoc `inNote` so it creates a `Span` with class `csl-note`
    rather than a `Note`.  This should make it easier to integrate
    citations with ordinary notes in pandoc.
  * Do not hyperlink author-only citations (#77).  If we do this we get
    two consecutive hyperlinks for author-in-text forms.
  * `movePunctuationInsideQuotes`: only move `,` and `.`, not `?` and `!`,
    as per the CSL spec.

## 0.4.0.1

  * Fix bug introduced by the fix to #61 (#74).
    In certain circumstances, we could get doubled "et al.".
  * Depend on unicode-collation unconditionally (#71).  It is necessary
    even when text-icu is used, because of Text.Collate.Lang.
  * Rename tests in extra/ so they fall into categories.

## 0.4

  * We now use Lang from unicode-collation rather than defining our own.
    The type constructor has changed, as has the signature of
    parseLang.
  * Use unicode-collation by default for more accurate sorting.
    - text-icu will still be used if the icu flag is set.  This may
      give better performance, at the cost of depending on a large
      C library.
    - Change type of SortKeyValue so it doesn't embed Lang. [API change]
      Instead, we now store a language-specific collator in the Eval Context.
    - Move compSortKeyValues from Types to Eval.
  * Add curly open quote to word splitters in normalizeSortKey.
  * Improve date sorting: use the format YYYY0000 if no month, day,
    and YYYYMM00 if no day when generating sort keys.
  * Special treatment of literal "others" as last name in a list (#61).
    When we convert bibtex/biblatex bibliographies, the form "and others"
    yields a last name with nameLiteral = "others".  We detect this and
    generate a localized "and others" (et al).
  * Make abbreviations case-insensitive (#45).

## 0.3.0.9

 * Implement `et-al-subsequent-min` and `et-al-subsequent-use-first` (#60).

## 0.3.0.8

 * In parsing abbreviations JSON, ignore top-level fields
   besides "default" (#57), e.g. "info" which is used in Zotero's
   default abbreviations file.

## 0.3.0.7

  * Remove check for ASCII in case transform code.
    Previously we weren't doing case transform on words
    containing non-ASCII characters.

## 0.3.0.6

  * Fix infinite loop in `fixPunct` (#49).  In a few rare cases
    `fixPunct` would hang.

## 0.3.0.5

  * Add a space between "no date" term and disambiguator
    if the long form is used (#47).

## 0.3.0.4

  * Improve disambiguation code.  Add type signatures,
    move some functions to the top-level, and make the
    logic clearer and more efficient.
  * Re-render after each stage of ambiguity resolution
    instead of relying on analysis of names and dates.
    This is necessary especially for styles like
    chicago-note-bibliography which use titles in
    citations.  Closes #44.  No measurable
    performance impact.
  * Update test suite from upstream.
  * Update `it-IT` locale.

## 0.3.0.3

  * Fix author-only citations (#43).  We got bad results with some
    styles when a reference had both an author and a translator.

## 0.3.0.2

  * Don't use cite-group delimiter if ANY citation in group has
    locator (#38).  This seems to be citeproc.js's behavior and it gives
    better results for chicago-author-date:  we want both
    `[@foo20; @foo21, p. 3]` and `[@foo20, p. 3; @foo21]` to produce
    a semicolon separator, rather than a comma.

## 0.3.0.1

  * Better handle `initialize-with` that ends in a nonbreaking space.
    In this case, citeproc should not add an additional space
    or strip the nonbreaking space.  Closes #37.


## 0.3

  * Change `makeReferenceMap` to return a cleaned-up list of
    references as well as a reference map.  The cleanup-up list
    removes references with duplicate ids.  When there are multiple
    references with the same id, the last one is included and
    the others discarded.  [API change]

## 0.2.0.1

  * FromJSON for Name: make straight quotes curly.
    Otherwise nothing will do this, when we are decoding
    JSON to (Reference a), a /= CslJson Text.
  * Remove redundant pragmas and imports (Albert Krewinkel).
  * Use custom prelude with GHC 8.6.* and older (Albert
    Krewinkel).  This adds support for GHC 8.0.x.

## 0.2

  * Remove `AfterOtherPunctuation` constructor from
    `CaseTransformState` [API change].
    This gave bad results with things like parentheses (#27).
  * Change `SortKeyValue` to include `Maybe Lang` [API change].
    This allows us to do locale-sensitive sorting (though this
    won't matter much unless the `icu` flag is used).
  * Add `Maybe Lang` parameter on `initialize` (since
    capitalization can be locale-dependent).
  * Add cabal.project.icu for building with icu lib.
  * Add (unexported) Citeproc.Unicode compatibility module.
    This allows us to use the same functions whether or not
    the `icu` flag is used.

## 0.1.1.1

  * Pay attention to citationNoteNumber in computing position.
    In calculating whether an item is alone in its citation,
    we need to take into account citationNoteNumber, since
    two citations may occur in the same note and they should
    not be ranked "alone." See jgm/pandoc#6813,
    citation-style-language/documentation#121

## 0.1.1

  * Ensure that uncited references are sorted last
    when it comes to assigning citation numbers (#22).
  * Remove "capitalize initial term" feature.  This is required by
    the test suite but not the spec.  It makes more sense for us to do
    this capitalization in the calling program, e.g. pandoc.  For some
    citations in note styles may already be in notes and thus not
    trigger separate footnotes.  If initial terms had been capitalized,
    we'd need to uncapitalize, and that is hard to do reliably.
  * Treat empty `FancyVal` as an empty value.
  * Derive Functor, Traversable, Foldable for Result [API change].

## 0.1.0.3

  * Better handling of author-only/suppress-author.
    Previously all results of "names" elements were treated
    as authors.  But only the first should be (generally this
    is the author, but it could be the editor of an edited
    volume with no author).  See jgm/pandoc#6765.

## 0.1.0.2

  * Don't enclose contents of e:choose in a Formatted element (#19).
    The e:choose element is "transparent" and the delimiter
    controlling its formatting should be inserted between
    the items it returns.

## 0.1.0.1

  * Fix sorting when no `<sorting>` element given. The spec says:
    "In the absence of cs:sort, cites and bibliographic entries appear in
    the order in which they are cited." This affects IEEE in particular.  See
    jgm/pandoc#6741.

  * Improve `sameNames` and citation grouping.  Preivously if a citation
    item had a prefix, it would not be grouped with following citations.
    See jgm/pandoc#6722 for discussion.

  * Remove unneeded `hasNoSuffix` check in `sameNames`.

  * Remove unneeded import

  * `citeproc` executable: strip BOM before parsing style (#18).

## 0.1

  * Initial release.
