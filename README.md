This library generates citations and bibliography formatted
according to a [CSL] style.  Currently version 1.0.2 of the CSL
spec is targeted.

This library is a successor to pandoc-citeproc, which was a fork
of Andrea Rossato's citeproc-hs.  I always found it difficult to
fix bugs in pandoc-citeproc and decided that implementing
citeproc from scratch would give me a better basis for
understanding.  This library has a number of other advantages
over pandoc-citeproc:

- it is much faster (as a rough benchmark, running the CSL
  test suite takes less than 4 seconds with this library,
  compared to 12 seconds with pandoc-citeproc)

- it interprets CSL more faithfully, passing more of the CSL
  tests

- it has fewer dependencies (in particular, it does not depend
  on pandoc)

- it is more flexible, not being tied to pandoc's types.

Unlike pandoc-citeproc, this library does not provide an
executable.  It will be used in pandoc itself to provide
integrated citation support and bibliography format conversion
(so the pandoc-citeproc filter will no longer be necessary).

## How to use it

The main point of entry is the function `citeproc` from the
module `Citeproc`.  This takes as arguments:

- a `CiteprocOptions` structure, which includes the following options:

  * `linkCitations` controls whether citations are hyperlinked 
     to the bibliography.

  * `linkBibliography` automatically linkifies any identifiers (DOI, 
     PMCID, PMID, or URL) appearing in a bibliography entry.  When an
     entry has a DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL available but none of these
     are rendered by the style, add a link to the title (or, if no title
     is present, the whole entry), using the URL for the DOI, PMCID, 
     PMID, or URL (in that order of priority).  See
     [Appendix VI](https://github.com/citation-style-language/documentation/blob/master/specification.rst#appendix-vi-links)
     of the CSL v1.0.2 spec.


- a `Style`, which you will want to produce by parsing a CSL
  style file using `parseStyle` from `Citeproc.Style`.

- Optionally a `Lang`, which allows you to override a default locale,

- a list of `Reference`s, which you can produce from a CSL JSON
  bibliography using aeson's `decode`,

- a list of `Citation`s (each of which may have multiple
  `CitationItems`).

It yields a `Result`, which includes a list of formatted
citations and a formatted bibliography, as well any warnings
produced in evaluating the style.

The types are parameterized on a `CiteprocOutput` instance `a`,
which represents formatted content in your bibliographic
fields (e.g. the title).  If you want a classic CSL processor,
you can use `CslJson Text`.  But you can also use another type,
such as a pandoc `Inlines`.  All you need to do is define
an instance of `CiteprocOutput` for your type (and also construct
the `Reference`s and `Citation`s using your type).

The signature of `parseStyle` may not be self-evident:
the first argument is a function that takes a URL and
retrieves the text from that URL.  This is used to fetch
the "independent parent" of a dependent style.  You can supply
whatever function you like: it can search your local file
system or fetch the content via HTTP.  If you're not using
dependent styles, you can get by with `\_ -> return mempty`.

## How it works underneath

This library understands CSL style files, and the formatting
changes (stylistic choices) that they specify. The rules for
making these changes are codified in the `CiteprocOutput`
typeclass, which requires defining various formatting
transformations for the parameterized type, such as adding
bold emphasis, making things uppercase or lowercase, etc.
This library can apply the CSL style file to `CslJson Text`
and `Inlines`, because those types define a `CiteprocOutput`
instance.

In case it is not obvious, this library can only work with
one parameterized type at a time. For example, it doesn't
know how to read CSL JSON bibliography (`CslJson Text`) and
produce `Result`s using `Inlines`.

## The citeproc executable

If the package is compiled with the `executable` flag, an
executable `citeproc` will be built.  `citeproc` reads
a JSON-encoded `Inputs` object from `stdin` (or from
a file if a filename is provided) and writes
a JSON-encoded `Result` object to `stdout`.  It does so by
using `CslJson Text` underneath.  This executable
can be used to add citation processing to non-Haskell projects.

`citeproc --help` will summarize usage information.  See
the [man page](man/citeproc.1.md) for more information.

## Known bugs and limitations

Although this library is much more accurate in implementing the
CSL spec than pandoc-citeproc was, it still fails some of the
tests from the CSL test suite (62/818).  However, most of the
failures are on minor corner cases, and in many cases the
expected behavior goes beyond what is required by the CSL spec.
(For example, we intentionally refrain from capitalizing
terms in initial position in note styles. It makes more sense
for the calling program, e.g. pandoc, to do the capitalization
when it puts the citations in notes, since some citations
in note styles may already be in notes and in this case
their rendering may not require capitalization. It is easy
to capitalize reliably, hard to uncapitalize reliably.)
