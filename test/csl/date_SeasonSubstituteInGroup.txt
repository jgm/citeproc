Grouping ordinarily causes bare terms to be suppressed if
at least one attempt is made to render a variable in an
enclosing group, and all such attempts fail.  Seasons are
rendered as terms output instead of the month.  Where only
the month is requested, it will fail (triggering the season
term write operation).  This test confirms that in this
special case, the term is treated as if it were a successful
rendering of a variable.
